# ODIN-RECIPES - logic and structure


This will be very simplistic of a project:

The ideal of the project is nothing more then a webpage that is displaying recipes that I have decided to mark as go to foods. 

The recipes are not re-written as my recipe like other students might have done. As a food lover and all around foodie. I think it is important not to impose success to foods or recipes of others as ours. 

All the recipes are just coded as links to the source of where the recipe is and was obtained from. 

The page will be styled from me personally but the links are keeping the source of the recipe as theres as it should be. Definitely don't wanna crossing the line of plagiarism 

I added a footer section that just shows the copyright (its hypothetical) and the creator company of the place that coded the website.
