        <ul>
            <p>Ingredients: </p>

            <li>3 pounds chicken, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup of milk</li>
            <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups canola or peanut oil</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <p>Directions: </p>
            <li>Rinse the chicken pieces with cold water and pat dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li>In a shallow bowl, beat the eggs with the milk, and stir in the salt, pepper and garlic powder. Soak the chicken in the milk mixture for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine the flour and seasoned salt (if using) in a large zip-loc plastic bag. Add the chicken pieces, a few at a time, and shake to coat completely in the flour. Shake off any excess and set the chicken aside on a rack to dry while the oil heats.</li>
            <li>Pour the oil into a deep skillet or deep fryer and heat to 350 degrees F. Add chicken thighs and legs and cook for several minutes.</li>
            <li>Add other chicken pieces being careful not to overcrowd the skillet. Continue cooking, turning once, until the chicken pieces are golden brown and cooked through. Drain the crispy fried chicken on paper towels and serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
